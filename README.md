-package name sorting from first to end
-filtering based of packages
-every two week store the pull
-after clicking on one package it should go in it and list the classes of that packages with their metrics and if i click on class it should show methods of that class with their metrics
- allow it to search from even a single word like if i search customer all the customer packages should list down see if we can use any data structure
- total classes , instruction cov , branch cov , average cov , status(low,high,moderate) should keep only those metrics other all ignore
